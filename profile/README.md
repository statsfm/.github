# stats.fm

Hi, we are building stats.fm (previously known as Spotistats).

stats.fm provides insight into your most listened songs and artists, with a choice of different periods.
What makes this app unique is that you can track your streaming history and view the amount of times youâ€™ve played a song or artist!

You can download stats.fm via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.netlob.spotistats) and [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/spotistats-for-spotify/id1526912392).
Apart from that we are working on a website on which you can view your statistics too, [https://stats.fm](https://stats.fm). Keep in mind that the site is still in development and not finished yet.

## Contributing & support

You can contribute by translating the mobile application to more languages [here](https://translate.spotistats.app).

We also have a support documentation over at [https://support.stats.fm](https://support.stats.fm) which can be translated over [here](https://crowdin.com/project/statsfm-support).
